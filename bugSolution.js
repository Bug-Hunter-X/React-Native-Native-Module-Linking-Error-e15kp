The solution involves ensuring that the native module is correctly linked to your project.  This often means running specific commands depending on the native module and the method it uses for linking.  React Native projects often use tools like `react-native link` (older projects), but modern libraries often handle the linking process differently. Check the native module's documentation for the proper linking procedure.

For example, some libraries use autolinking, requiring only to install the library. Others require manual linking steps involving Xcode and/or Android Studio. Make sure you followed all steps as described in the library's instructions. 

Example of a proper setup with autolinking (assuming the library properly supports it):

1. **Installation:** `expo install react-native-some-library` (or `yarn add react-native-some-library`)
2. **(If necessary) Run Linking commands:**  Refer to the library's documentation to check if manual linking steps are needed. 
3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Often, a clean build is necessary.  In Android, you might clean the project, while in iOS, you could clean the build folder in Xcode.

Ensure your native project (Android and iOS) has the correct configurations and dependencies reflected from the steps above.  If issues persist, check for any error messages provided by the build process.  The error messages will often give clues as to where the problem lies, such as a missing header file or an incorrect path.

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import RNSomeLibrary from 'react-native-some-library'; // After successful linking

// ...
RNSomeLibrary.someMethod(); // This should now work correctly
```
