This error occurs when using a third-party library or package that has native dependencies, and these dependencies are not correctly linked or configured in your React Native project.  This often manifests as an error during the build process or when running the app, indicating missing modules or undefined symbols. For example, you might get errors like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'RNSomeLibrary.someMethod')` if a native module is not correctly linked.

Example:
```javascript
import RNSomeLibrary from 'react-native-some-library';

// ... later in the code ...
RNSomeLibrary.someMethod(); // This will throw an error if the native module isn't linked
```
